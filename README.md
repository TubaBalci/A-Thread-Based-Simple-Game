Sliding Monsters Game
The Sliding Monsters Game is a simple Java program that simulates a game where a player controls a green square and tries to avoid blue squares (monsters) that slide across the screen. The objective is to survive as long as possible without being caught by a monster.

How to Play
Use the following keys to control the green square:

A: Move left
D: Move right
W: Move up
S: Move down
The green square starts at coordinates (240, 240) in a 500x500 window.

Blue squares (monsters) move towards the green square in a sliding motion.

If a monster comes within 20 pixels of the green square, it will try to chase and catch it.

The player must navigate the green square to avoid being caught by the monsters.

The game continues until the green square is caught by a monster.
